## About Me

Yes it is me, real Digital Cheese/DCTheGamr from YouTube and 3DSPaint. I often do cool web-development related stuff here. I am trying to learn JS right now, shouldn't take too long to figure out. If you need anything, DM me on 3DSPaint or Twitter.

## Questions/Answers

*Why Not Seperate Repositories For Old Archives?*

Because its inconvenient for me to view lol. On top of that, I don't like people having to search through 100s of repositories for everything they want whenever the entire archive is often less than 30MB of content. Its a waste of time, avoid it.

*Do You Plan On Learning More Than HTML/CSS/JS?*

Yes of course. PHP and maybe Python as well. I wanna actually get good at this stuff, its pretty fun to do lmao.
