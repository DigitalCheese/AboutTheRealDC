# About Me

Hello! I am a random programmer on the internet. I usually do some cool stuff here that you can check out. I usually work on DC-Blog but I sometimes work on other repositories. Everything I make is perfectly ok to host yourself unless said otherwise as long as you give credit to me.

You don't need to put it on every page that has my content in cases where its a rehost of websites I made, just put my name in a tiny section such as a credits page. Have fun looking through my code!
